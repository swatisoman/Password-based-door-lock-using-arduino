                                PASSWORD BASED DOOR LOCK
The Password-Based Door Switch Simulation is a fun and educational project that mimics the functionality of a secure door system. Although it’s not meant for real-world security applications, it provides valuable insights into how electronic locks and access control work.

Project Overview
Objective:
The primary goal of this simulation is to allow users to enter a secret password using a keypad.
If the correct password is entered, the “door” (represented by a relay) opens.
How It Works:
The user interacts with the keypad to input a password.
The Arduino compares the entered password with a predefined one.
If the passwords match, the relay is activated (simulating the door opening).
Otherwise, an error message is displayed.
Learning Opportunities:
Understand how keypads work and how to interface them with an Arduino.
Explore basic circuitry using a relay module.
Practice programming logic for password validation.
